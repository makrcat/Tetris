## Tetris :D

I made this a couple years ago
thought i'd put it on here!

## Tips:

You may need to change your system settings so that VSCode (or whatever you're running this on) can access keyboard events!

For MacOS, you might also want to disable the press-and-hold feature for accented characters. 
`defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false`
`defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true`
it doesn't make *that* much of a difference though
