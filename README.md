## Tetris :D

I made this a couple years ago

thought i'd put it on here!

## How to play:

go to cloned project directory:

`source venv/bin/activate` <-- activate virtual environment

`pip install -r requirements.txt` (or pip3)

`python3 main.py`

something of that sort

## Tips:

You mayyy need to change your system settings so that VSCode (or whatever you're running this on) can access keyboard events!

For MacOS, you might also want to disable the press-and-hold feature for accented characters. 

`defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false`

`defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true`

it doesn't make *that* much of a difference though
